# Organize_Podcasts
In the third section on python in Udacity's intro to programming nanodegree, we created a program that would organize blank photos.
I wanted to get more practice working with python(because I have enjoyed python the most),
so I decided to try to repurpose the organize_photos program we made to organize to my hardcore history podcasts.
However, it was not as simple as just changing some of the names, the nature of the podcasts made it a bit more interesting.
This code is not a streamlined program that could be used on any computer, I had to do edit the original hardcore history
mp3 files to have specific markers to find in a split. I also had to add a sepcification to each podcast (i.e. standalone,
series, addendum, etc.).
I am adding it here for two reasons:

1. Even though I know that this code and the process I went through to make it work is inefficient,
I am proud of myself for being able to do this and would like to show it off.

2. I want to see if anyone else has done something similar, and if they have, I want to talk with them and see how they did it.
Because I am sure that this is not the most efficient way to do this. I'm still learning and want to learn even more.

If someone does want to try to use this code as a template to do something similar. They can change the source and destinations
as they see fit, because I made the functions that perform the work take a directory argument. To help explain what I did to the original mp3 files even more here is an example of how I edited one of the files:
